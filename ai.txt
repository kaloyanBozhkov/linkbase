Linkbase â€“ A personal database of your connections

This is a simple but elegant looking app which lets user add connections with info about:
- what their name is
- what their IG/social handle is -> with a link pointing to the IG page so they dont have to type it twice in order to follow the account
- where and when they met (when is automatically added)
- one or more facts about the other personal

The app should also have a main screen view where connnections are listed by recency and there is a search bar that allows searchig contacts by fact.
All data should be stored locally on the device.

Divide the TypeScript app in 2 parts, the mobile app and backend app. 
Tech to use for mobile app:

React Native
Nativewind
Zustand
axios

Tech to use for backend app:
Node
Express
Prisma + Postgresql db
Zod
